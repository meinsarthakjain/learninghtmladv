# HTML Journey

Learning HTML from absolute zero.

This repository contains my day-wise learning and practice files as I build a strong foundation in HTML.

## Structure
- day-1: HTML basics, tags, elements
- day-2: Links, id, class, image, attribute
- Day 3: lists, nested lists, semantic layout
- Day 4: HTML forms, labels, inputs, submit
- Day 5: HTML form validation and accessibility
