                <h3>Virat Kohli</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <h4>Test</h4>
                    <p>As Test captain, Kohli turned India into a dominant force by 
                        winning an away series in Sri Lanka, beating South Africa at 
                        home, reclaiming the No. 1 Test ranking and holding it for five 
                        consecutive years. In T20Is, he created history by winning 
                        back-to-back Player of the Tournament awards in the 2014 
                        and 2016 ICC Men’s T20 World Cups. He delivered one of the 
                        greatest away Test batting performances in 2018, scoring 593 
                        runs in England, before leading India to a historic first-ever 
                        Test series victory in Australia later that year.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>His 2023 Peak</h4>
                        <p>Kohli reached another peak in the 2023 ODI World Cup, scoring 
                            3 centuries, breaking Sachin Tendulkar’s record with his 50th ODI 
                            hundred, and becoming the player with the most centuries in ODI 
                            history. He also set the record for most runs in a single World C
                            up with 765 runs and won the Player of the Tournament award and 
                            leading India to the final.</p>
